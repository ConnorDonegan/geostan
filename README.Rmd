## geostan: Bayesian spatial analysis

The [**geostan**](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/) R package supports a complete spatial analysis workflow with Bayesian models for areal data, including a suite of functions for visualizing spatial data and model results. **geostan** models were built using [**Stan**](https://mc-stan.org), a state-of-the-art platform for Bayesian modeling. The package is designed partly for public health research with spatial data, for which it complements the [**surveil**](https://connordonegan.github.io/surveil/) R package for time series analysis of public health surveillance data.

Features include:

* **Disease mapping and spatial regression** Statistical models for data recorded across areal units like states, counties, or census tracts.
* **Spatial analysis tools** Tools for visualizing and measuring spatial autocorrelation and map patterns, for exploratory analysis and model diagnostics.  
* **Observational uncertainty** Incorporate information on data reliability, such as standard errors of American Community Survey estimates, into any **geostan** model.
* **Missing and Censored observations** Vital statistics and disease surveillance systems like CDC Wonder censor case counts that fall below a threshold number; **geostan** can model disease or mortality risk for small areas with censored observations or with missing observations.
* **The RStan ecosystem** Interfaces easily with many high-quality R packages for Bayesian modeling.
* **Custom spatial models** Tools for building custom spatial models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

## Installation

Install **geostan** from CRAN using:

``` r
install.packages("geostan")
```

## Support

All functions and methods are documented (with examples) on the website [reference](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html) page. See the package [vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html) for more on exploratory spatial analysis, spatial measurement error models, spatial regression with raster layers, and building custom spatial model in Stan.

## Usage

Load the package and the `georgia` county mortality data set:
```{r}
library(geostan)
data(georgia)
```

This has county population and mortality data by sex for ages 55-64, and for the period 2014-2018. As is common for public access data, some of the observations missing because the CDC has censored them. 

The `sp_diag` function provides visual summaries of spatial data, including a histogram, Moran scatter plot, and map. Here is a visual summary of crude female mortality rates (as deaths per 10,000):

```{r fig.width = 8}
A <- shape2mat(georgia, style = "B")
mortality_rate <- georgia$rate.female * 10e3
sp_diag(mortality_rate, georgia, w = A)
```

The following code fits a spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to female county mortality data. These models are used for estimating disease risk in small areas like counties, and for analyzing covariation of health outcomes with other area qualities. The R syntax for fitting the models is similar to using `lm` or `glm`. We provide the population at risk (the denominator for mortality rates) as an offset term, using the log-transform. In this case, three of the observations are missing because they have been censored; per CDC criteria, this means that there were 9 or fewer deaths in those counties. By using the `censor_point` argument and setting it to `censor_point = 9`, the model will account for the censoring process when providing estimates of the mortality rates:

```{r}
cars <- prep_car_data(A)
fit <- stan_car(deaths.female ~ offset(log(pop.at.risk.female)),
                censor_point = 9,
		data = georgia,
		car_parts = cars,
		family = poisson(),
		cores = 4, # for multi-core processing
		refresh = 0) # to silence some printing
```

Passing a fitted model to the `sp_diag` function will return a set of diagnostics for spatial models:

```{r fig.width = 8}
sp_diag(fit, georgia, w = A)
```

The `print` method returns a summary of the probability distributions for model parameters, as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics from Stan (Monte Carlo standard errors of the mean `se_mean`, effective sample size `n_eff`, and the R-hat statistic `Rhat`):

```{r}
print(fit)
```

Applying the `fitted` method to the fitted model will return the fitted values from the model - in this case, the fitted values are the estimates of the county mortality rates. Multiplying them by 10,000 gives mortality rate per 10,000 at risk:

```{r}
mortality_est <- fitted(fit) * 10e3
county_name <- georgia$NAME
head( cbind(county_name, mortality_est) )
```

The mortality estimates are stored in the column named "mean", and the limits of the 95\% credible interval are found in the columns "2.5%" and "97.5%".

Details and demonstrations can be found in the package [help pages](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html) and [vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html).
