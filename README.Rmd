## geostan: Bayesian spatial analysis

The [**geostan**](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/) R package supports a complete spatial analysis workflow with Bayesian models for areal data, including a suite of functions for visualizing spatial data and model results. For demonstrations and discussion, see the package [help pages](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html) and [vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html) on spatial autocorrelation and spatial measurement error models.

The package is designed primarily to support public health research with spatial data; see the [**surveil**](https://connordonegan.github.io/surveil/) R package for time series analysis of public health surveillance data.

**geostan** is an interface to [**Stan**](https://mc-stan.org), a state-of-the-art platform for Bayesian inference. 

### Disease mapping and spatial regression

Model small-area incidence rates with mortality or disease data recorded across areal units like states, counties, or census tracts.

### Observational uncertainty 

Incorporate information on data reliability, such as standard errors of American Community Survey estimates, into any **geostan** model.

### Censored observations

Vital statistics and disease surveillance systems like CDC Wonder censor case counts that fall below a threshold number; **geostan** can model disease or mortality risk with censored observations.

### Spatial analysis tools

Tools for visualizing and measuring spatial autocorrelation and map patterns, for exploratory analysis and model diagnostics. Visual diagnostics also support the evaluation of survey data quality and observational error models.

### The RStan ecosystem

Compatible with a suite of high-quality R packages for Bayesian inference and model evaluation.

### Custom spatial models

Tools for building custom spatial models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

## Installation

Install **geostan** from CRAN using:

``` r
install.packages("geostan")
```

## Usage

Load the package and the `georgia` county mortality data set (ages 55-64, years 2014-2018):
```{r}
library(geostan)
data(georgia)
```

The `sp_diag` function provides visual summaries of spatial data, including a histogram, Moran scatter plot, and map:

```{r fig.width = 8}
sp_diag(georgia$rate.female, georgia)
```

There are three censored observations in the `georgia` female mortality data, which means there were 9 or fewer deaths in those counties. The following code fits a spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to female county mortality data. By using the `censor_point` argument we include our information on the censored observations to obtain results for all counties:

```{r}
A <- shape2mat(georgia, style = "B")
cars <- prep_car_data(A)
fit <- stan_car(deaths.female ~ offset(log(pop.at.risk.female)),
                censor_point = 9,
		data = georgia,
		car_parts = cars,
		family = poisson(),
		cores = 4, # for multi-core processing
		refresh = 0) # to silence some printing
```
Passing a fitted model to the `sp_diag` function will return a set of diagnostics for spatial models:
```{r fig.width = 8}
sp_diag(fit, georgia, w = A)
```

The `print` method returns a summary of the probability distributions for model parameters, as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics from Stan (Monte Carlo standard errors of the mean `se_mean`, effective sample size `n_eff`, and the R-hat statistic `Rhat`):

```{r}
print(fit)
```
More demonstrations can be found in the package [help pages](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html) and [vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html).
