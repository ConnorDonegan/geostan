## geostan: Bayesian spatial analysis

The [**geostan**](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/) R package
supports a complete spatial analysis workflow with Bayesian models for
areal data, including a suite of functions for visualizing spatial data
and model results. For demonstrations and discussion, see the package
[help
pages](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html) and
[vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html)
on spatial autocorrelation, spatial measurement error models, spatial
regression with raster layers, and building custom spatial model in
Stan.

The package is particularly suitable for public health research with
spatial data, and complements the
[**surveil**](https://connordonegan.github.io/surveil/) R package for
time series analysis of public health surveillance data.

**geostan** models were built using [**Stan**](https://mc-stan.org), a
state-of-the-art platform for Bayesian modeling.

### Disease mapping and spatial regression

Statistical models for data recorded across areal units like states,
counties, or census tracts.

### Observational uncertainty

Incorporate information on data reliability, such as standard errors of
American Community Survey estimates, into any **geostan** model.

### Censored observations

Vital statistics and disease surveillance systems like CDC Wonder censor
case counts that fall below a threshold number; **geostan** can model
disease or mortality risk with censored observations.

### Spatial analysis tools

Tools for visualizing and measuring spatial autocorrelation and map
patterns, for exploratory analysis and model diagnostics.

### The RStan ecosystem

Interfaces easily with many high-quality R packages for Bayesian
modeling.

### Custom spatial models

Tools for building custom spatial models in
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

## Installation

Install **geostan** from CRAN using:

``` r
install.packages("geostan")
```

## Support

All functions and methods are documented (with examples) on the website
[reference](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/reference/index.html)
page. See the package
[vignettes](https://connordonegan.github.io/geostan/articles/index.html)
for more on exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial measurement error
models, and spatial regression with large raster layers.

features please visit the

## Usage

Load the package and the `georgia` county mortality data set (ages
55-64, years 2014-2018):

``` r
library(geostan)
#> This is geostan version 0.5.3
data(georgia)
```

The `sp_diag` function provides visual summaries of spatial data,
including a histogram, Moran scatter plot, and map:

``` r
A <- shape2mat(georgia, style = "B")
sp_diag(georgia$rate.female, georgia, w = A)
#> 3 NA values found in x will be dropped from data x and matrix w
#> Warning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).
```

There are three censored observations in the `georgia` female mortality
data, which means there were 9 or fewer deaths in those counties. The
following code fits a spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to
female county mortality data. By using the `censor_point` argument we
include our information on the censored observations to obtain results
for all counties:

``` r
cars <- prep_car_data(A)
#> Range of permissible rho values:  -1.661134 1
fit <- stan_car(deaths.female ~ offset(log(pop.at.risk.female)),
                censor_point = 9,
        data = georgia,
        car_parts = cars,
        family = poisson(),
        cores = 4, # for multi-core processing
        refresh = 0) # to silence some printing
#> 
#> *Setting prior parameters for intercept

#>   location scale
#> 1     -4.7     5
#> 
#> *Setting prior for CAR scale parameter (car_scale)
#> Distribution: student_t
#>   df location scale
#> 1 10        0     3
#> 
#> *Setting prior for CAR spatial autocorrelation parameter (car_rho)
#> Distribution: uniform
#>   lower upper
#> 1  -1.7     1
#> Warning: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess
#> Warning: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess
```

Passing a fitted model to the `sp_diag` function will return a set of
diagnostics for spatial models:

``` r
sp_diag(fit, georgia, w = A)
#> Using sp_diag(y, shape, rates = TRUE, ...). To examine data as (unstandardized) counts, use rates = FALSE.
#> 3 NA values found in x will be dropped from data x and matrix w
#> Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_pointrange()`).
```

The `print` method returns a summary of the probability distributions
for model parameters, as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
diagnostics from Stan (Monte Carlo standard errors of the mean
`se_mean`, effective sample size `n_eff`, and the R-hat statistic
`Rhat`):

``` r
print(fit)

#> Link function:  log
