The **geostan** R package provides a user-friendly interface to
hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) for areal data. It is designed for relative ease of use and developed with a particular emphasis on spatial epidemiology and survey data for public health. All of the models are built with the Stan programming language, but users only need to be familiar with the R language.

**The package and website are still under development.**

Tools for visualizing and measuring spatial autocorrelation and map patterns, for exploratory analysis and model diagnostics.

### Disease mapping and spatial regression

Model small-area incidence rates with mortality or disease data recorded across areal units like counties or census tracts.

### Observational error models 

Incorporate information on data quality into any **geostan** model. Built specifically for American Community Survey (ACS) data.

### The RStan ecosystem

Compatible with a suite of high-quality R packages for Bayesian inference and model evaluation.
